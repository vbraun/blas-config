Simple BLAS Benchmark

Taken from BlasBench, part of LLCbench. Released under the GPL (any
version), see COPYING.

This benchmark also serves as an example for how to use
cblas/f77blas/lapack in your own autotool-based projects. There are
two bits to it: First, your configure.ac (or configure.in if you still
use the old naming convention) must contain, say, 

    PKG_CHECK_MODULES([CBLAS], [cblas])

if you want to use the C BLAS. This defines the variables CBLAS_CFLAGS
and CBLAS_LIBS in your automake files. Typically, you would then add
them to the compiler flags in your src/Makefile.am as in:
 
    myprogram_CFLAGS = $(CBLAS_CFLAGS)
    myprogram_LDADD = $(CBLAS_LIBS)

To test a cblas.pc file that is not installed in the standard
pkgconfig search path you can set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment
variable when running configure:

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/cblas/ ./configure
