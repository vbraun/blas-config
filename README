Automatic BLAS Configuration
============================

The goal of this program is to automatically pick the most suitable
BLAS implementation found on the computer and install pkgconfig (*.pc)
files for it. This then enables other programs to compile and link to
BLAS without having to know anything about the implementation.


Installation
============

Run ./configure && make && make install as usual.

TODO: implement configure switch to manually select and/or specify
alternate directories.


For BLAS Users
==============

See bench/README for an example of how to integrate pkgconfig in your
autotools project.
